 Deconstructing and rebuilding the Google homepage.

This project is part of the [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)'s [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css), focusing on front-end development.

For this project, the task was deconstructing the Google homepage and recreating it using the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS obtained during previous lessons. The goal was not to create a 1:1 replica of the page, but to start thinking about how elements get placed on a page and how they get styled and aligned.

This was my first time truly building a web page using HTML, even though I've had many experiences messing around with HTML (not as much with CSS).

For the homepage, the first thing I did was to structure the page in different sections on paper: top, middle and bottom.
	
	The top is the simplest, being two links and a button.
	The middle is made of four parts: the logo, the search bar, the Search button and the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
	The bottom has a left and a right section, each made of three links.

From there, I proceded to create the HTML of the page.
